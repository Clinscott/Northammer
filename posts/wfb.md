As a kid I loved anything mediaeval. Some of my earliest memories involved picking up a stick from the ground and clashing with my brothers or a friend. We were King Arthur and his knights of the round, or Robin Hood and I Little John. From here we progressed to Dungeons and Dragons and then finally, when old enough and allowance accumulated, Warhammer.
\
\
Now we had these figures before us, unbuilt and unpainted. My child sized hands and child mind bent to task to built and paint. I remember the shein of Mythril Steel painted on a Bretonian knight as it charged across the table towards its Lizard foe. I was enthralled, and Mythril Steel was painted heavily, perhaps too much so on many. I still like those colours today Mythril and Tin Bitz feature heavily in my armies.
\
\
Time moves on and so do our hobbies. I put Warhammer aside for years until my then girlfriend and now partner started working at a Comic Book Shop/Hobby Shop now called Kobald's Corner. Driving them to work one evening I stepped in and saw a group of guys standing around a table, and upon that table Warhammer Armies displayed in all their brilliance. I probably paid a few months rent to the owner of that shop.
\
\
The Warhammer community flourished there. My brother rejoined the hobby with his cool High Elves, and I took to the field with a Gentlemanly display of Dark Elves. Okay, so I was no better. Sixth edition was just being phased out at this point and seventh saw armies rise to extreme coolness. Everyone thought their army was the coolest and a ragtag group of six players bloomed to upwards of twelve. When the owner had to add more tables for people to play we knew Warhammer was in a good spot.
\
\
Then came Eighth.
\
\
The community felt cheated, suddenly our well built cool armies were too small. More! GamesWorkshop demanded, buy more! We did, for a time. But as I moved three blocks of forty Night Goblins across the table I began to realise, too late, that I had been had.
\
\
Now there are stirrings on the wind, whispers of a new promise land. I can see that shining knight once more charge across the land.
