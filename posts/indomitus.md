I hated 40k. I do not know why. But I hated it. It really makes no sense for as a kid, as Shadowrun was one of my favourite RPG's. Perhaps my mind only had room for one love, that of Warhammer Fantay Battles. Maybe it was because I always like rooting for the underdog, 40k was far more popular than Warhammer at the time, and still is.

Then came Indomitus. The box art alone was enough to draw someone in. The models were spectacular, the Marines had never looked so good. It helped that my brother loves Necrons. We split a box, and then he bought another, and another... And here we are!

Northammer's birth can be attributed to that first Indomitus box.
